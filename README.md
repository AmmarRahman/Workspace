# Workspace

Basic Workspace

## Usage instructions

* The workspace container is restarted automatically unless it is explicitly shut down.
* There are two aliases created for you, `workspace` to run commands on the container as your WSL user & `rootspace` to run as a root user.
  * `workspace zsh` would give you Zhell on your local username
